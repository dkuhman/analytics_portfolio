# Daniel Kuhman 

## Biography
Hi - I'm Daniel! I grew up in a small suburb of Cleveland, Ohio and currently live in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. I am a trained research scientist with a strong background in analytics and data science. I studied human movement - both biomechanics and motor control - throughout my time as an undergraduate, master's, and doctoral student. Following my successful dissertation defense, I became the Director of Data Science for City Enterprises, where I helped develop and implelement a data-driven approach to inventory optimizion, and vehicle acquisition and sales in the used car market. More recently, I served as a Data Analyst to Strike, a global, peer-to-peer payments app built on Bitcoin and Lightning. Amongst other roles, I served as an embedded analyst to the Trust & Safety and Fraud Ops teams, where I conducted analyses that helped drive in-app features that reduced fraud on the platform without compromising UX.  

I'm also a former Division I endurance athlete - I competed in cross country, indoor track, and outdoor track for the University of Memphis, where I earned 7 All-Conference titles, an All-Regional title in cross country, and was a school record holder in the indoor 5,000 meter run. While I no longer run to stay in shape, I stay active by training and competing in jiujitsu and going on hikes with my dog, Amy. 

## My Professionl Experience

## My Education
**University of Alabama at Birmingham, Ph.D. (2017 - 2021)**

I worked as a graduate research assistant in the UAB Biomechanics Lab and the Human Neuromodulation Lab while completing my doctor studies and dissertation research. My dissertation, titled "Gait Adaptability with Healthy Aging and Parkinson's Disease," was published in 2021. To date, my work at UAB has resulted in 11 peer-reviewed scientific publications. I graduated with a 4.0 GPA.

**East Carolina University, M.S. (2015 - 2017)**

I worked as a graduate research and teaching assistant in the ECU Biomechanics Lab while completing my master's studies and thesis research. As a research assistant, I completed my thesis, titled "The relationships between physical capacity and biomechanical plasticity in old adults during level and incline walking," in 2017 and published data related to this work in 2018 in the Journal of Biomechanics. As a teaching assistant, I taught 14 sections of an introductory course in the ECU department of Kinesiology and aided in laboratory work for upper level Biomechanics courses. I graduated with a 4.0 GPA.

**University of Memphis, B.S.Ed. (2011 - 2015)**

I was a 4 year member of the cross country, indoor track, and outdoor track teams, was a 7-time All-Conference and 1-time All-Regional athlete, and held the school record for the indoor 5,000 meter run. I also worked as an undergraduate research assistant in the Musculoskeletal Dynamics Lab and the Cardiorespiratory and Metabolic Lab. This work ultimately resulted in 3 peer-reviewed publications. I graduated Suma Cum Laude, with honors and a 3.8 GPA.
