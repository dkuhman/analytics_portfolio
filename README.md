## A bit about me
Hi - I'm Daniel! I grew up in a small suburb of Cleveland, Ohio and currently live in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. I am a trained research scientist with a strong background in analytics and data science. I studied human movement - both biomechanics and motor control - throughout my time as an undergraduate, master's, and doctoral student. Following my successful dissertation defense, I became the Director of Data Science for City Enterprises, where I helped develop and implelement a data-driven approach to inventory optimizion, and vehicle acquisition and sales in the used car market. More recently, I served as a Data Analyst to Strike, a global, peer-to-peer payments app built on Bitcoin and Lightning. Amongst other roles, I served as an embedded analyst to the Trust & Safety and Fraud Ops teams, where I conducted analyses that helped drive in-app features that reduced fraud on the platform without compromising UX.  

I'm also a former Division I endurance athlete - I competed in cross country, indoor track, and outdoor track for the University of Memphis, where I earned 7 All-Conference titles, an All-Regional title in cross country, and was a school record holder in the indoor 5,000 meter run. While I no longer run to stay in shape, I stay active by training and competing in jiujitsu and going on hikes with my dog, Amy.
